All options are within nested if statements but I initally tried to use switches and couldn't get them to work correctly.
I also tried creating a way to show pets were dead, but didn't have time to test and implement.

Otherwise, everything should be straight forward.

Please make sure to be carefull about spelling and capitalization.  
Pet names will not be recognized if they are not spelled as shown in the pet list.

Adding a pet with multiple names, the list will default to the first word of the pet's name.
